# A Kid Again Android

This is an app for a non-profit organization. The goal of this app is to provide a better way to connect and learn about A Kid Again. A Kid Again looks forward to the day that every child with a life-threatening illness in America can be A Kid Again. We include the whole family in every adventure we host year-round. Our families say adventures are something positive to look forward to and offer a distraction from routine medical care. Whether a child is battling an all too common disease like cancer, or a rare disease like Hunter Syndrome, they ALL deserve to be a kid again.
